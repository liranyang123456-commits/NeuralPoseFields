# NeuralPoseFields
We propose a camera pose estimation method based on implicit neural representation, which can obtain accurate predictions of the camera RT matrix based on sampled real poses.

We propose a novel method for 3D mesh and camera pose estimation. The dataset and related experimental code will be released after the paper is accepted. The datasets used in this method will be gradually published. Thank you for your attention!
